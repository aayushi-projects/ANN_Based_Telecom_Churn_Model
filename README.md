# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This project is focused on predicting customer churn in a telecom company using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The aim is to help telecom businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their services, so they can take action to retain them. The dataset used includes customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns.
The neural network model was built using Keras with TensorFlow backend and trained on cleaned, preprocessed data. The project also includes detailed analysis and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major issue in the telecom industry. Losing customers means losing recurring revenue. By predicting which customers are at risk of leaving, companies can take proactive steps to keep them. This project uses a deep learning approach to solve this classification problem.
## Dataset Details
The dataset includes the following features:

Demographic Info: Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents

Service Details: Internet Service, Online Security, Tech Support, Streaming Services

Account Info: Tenure, Monthly Charges, Total Charges, Contract Type, Payment Method

Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

The original dataset had over 7000 entries and required some cleaning before it could be used for training.
